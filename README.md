# Resume Classification with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

This repository contains code for a simple resume classification project using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The main goal of this project is to demonstrate how to use KNN to classify resumes based on the job positions applicants are interested in.

## Files

- `main.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for the resume classification project. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and predictions.
- `UpdatedResumeDataset.csv`: Dataset containing resume information.
- `requirements.txt`: A txt file containing the requirements.


## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LordRaleigh7926/ResumeAnalyser.git
cd ResumeAnalyser
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Open and run the `main.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter Notebook.

## Dataset

The `resume_dataset.csv` file contains a sample dataset with resume information.
